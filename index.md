## About Me

I am a fourth-year Statistics PhD student at the University of Chicago, where I am fortunate to be advised by Professor [Haifeng Xu](https://www.haifeng-xu.com/). Prior to joining UChicago, I had an wonderful year at the [Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health](https://sph.nus.edu.sg/) from 2020 to 2021, working on epidemic modeling under the supervision of Professor [Hannah Clapham](https://www.hannahclapham.com/). I completed my undergraduate studies at the National University of Singapore from 2016 to 2020, with double degrees in Statistics and Economics. My Bachelorâ€™s thesis was guided by Professors [Alex Cook](https://sph.nus.edu.sg/faculty-directory/cook-alex-richard/) and [Junjian Yi](https://sites.google.com/view/junjianyi).
